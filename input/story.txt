The rain drummed a relentless rhythm against the fogged windows of The Rusty Anchor, a small diner that smelled of burnt coffee and old vinyl.

Inside, three people sat at the corner booth, the air between them thick with unspoken tension.

Silas took a slow sip of his black coffee, his gaze fixed on the briefcase. "You’re late, Julian. In this business, late usually means followed."

Julian swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. "I took three different subways and walked through a department store. I’m clean, Silas. I swear."

Lena rolled her eyes, her fingers dancing across the screen of a tablet she had hidden under a napkin. "He’s mostly clean. You did trigger a geo-fence near the 4th Street station, but I scrambled the signal. You’re welcome."

"See?" Julian hissed, leaning in. "Lena’s got it covered. Can we just do this? I don't like the way the cook is looking at us."

Silas glanced toward the counter where a man in a greasy apron was flipping burgers with more aggression than necessary. "The cook is looking at you because you’re sweating enough to fill a bucket. Lean back. Breathe."

"I can't breathe!" Julian whispered. "Do you have any idea what’s in here? If the Board finds out I took these files—"

"If the Board finds out," Lena interrupted without looking up, "we’re all moving to a very small island with no internet. Now, stop talking and slide it over."

Julian hesitated. "Is the money ready?"

Silas reached into his coat and pulled out a plain white envelope. He didn't hand it over; he simply placed it on the table, keeping his hand firmly on top of it.

"Life is a series of trades, kid," Silas said, his voice dropping to a low gravel. "Information for security. Risk for reward. But the moment you let go of that handle, there’s no going back. Are you sure you want to be on this side of the line?"

Julian looked at Lena, who finally looked up from her tablet. Her expression softened, just for a second. "It's a one-way door, Julian. But it’s better than working for people who view you as a line item on a spreadsheet."

With a shaky breath, Julian slid the briefcase across the cracked Formica tabletop. Silas swapped it for the envelope with the grace of a card shark.

"Go out the back," Silas commanded. "There’s a blue sedan with the engine running. The driver's name is Marcus. He’ll take you to the safe house."

Julian grabbed the envelope and stood up, his legs looking like they might give way. "What happens to the files?"

Lena snapped her tablet shut and offered a grim smile. "By the time you reach the safe house, they won't exist anymore. And neither will the Board's bank accounts."

As Julian disappeared through the kitchen doors, Silas opened the briefcase just an inch. A faint blue glow reflected in his eyes.

"Well?" Lena asked, packing her gear. "Was it worth the gray hairs?"

Silas closed the lid with a satisfying click. "Ask me again when we’re on that island, Lena. For now, let’s get out of here. I think the cook is actually a federal agent."

Lena paused, her hand on her bag. "Wait, really?"

Silas stood up and winked. "No. But he does make a terrible omelet. Let’s go."
